**What a "Sample" is:** this agent was asked the exact same Best-Worst comparison task independently 3 time(s) in total (not a sequence of different questions). Repeated, independent sampling is a guardrail against treating any single completion as ground truth. 3 of those attempt(s) passed schema validation and are shown below, numbered in the order they were accepted; 0 were rejected (malformed JSON, a missing rating, a denylist match, etc.); see the Conversation Log tab for every rejected attempt and why.

## Sample 1 of 3 (Best: T_source, Worst: T_chain)

**Stated reasoning (submitted with the answer):**

Best factor: T_source  
Worst factor: T_chain

T_source vs T_history: 6  
T_source vs T_chain: 8  
T_history vs T_chain: 7

**Sources cited:** not reported by the model (no sources_used field in its response)

## Sample 2 of 3 (Best: T_source, Worst: T_history)

**Stated reasoning (submitted with the answer):**

Best factor: T_source  
Worst factor: T_history

T_source vs T_chain: 7  
T_source vs T_history: 8  
T_chain vs T_history: 7

**Sources cited:** not reported by the model (no sources_used field in its response)

## Sample 3 of 3 (Best: T_source, Worst: T_history)

**Stated reasoning (submitted with the answer):**

Best factor: T_source  
Worst factor: T_history

T_source vs T_chain: 7  
T_source vs T_history: 9  
T_chain vs T_history: 6

**Sources cited:** not reported by the model (no sources_used field in its response)
